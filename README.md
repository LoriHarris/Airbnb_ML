### Rachel Powell, Lori Harris, Brianna McKelvey

## Build on Airbnb App from Project 2
#Data Source: http://insideairbnb.com - New Orleans listings (option to add more cities)


### Techniques/possible areas for analysis:

#Use machine learning to determine the “best” Airbnb
#Linear regression (best time to buy); average $ per month 
#Models to predict good/bad based on features (e.g. amenities, # rms, location) 
#Apply models to compare with price - create our own star system (e.g. bins)
#Use ML to search comments for key words to determine quality of listings
#Clustering to compare quality with price
#Update user interface
