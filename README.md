## Build on Airbnb App from Project 2
- Data Source: http://insideairbnb.com - New Orleans listings (option to add more cities)


### Techniques/possible areas for analysis:

- Use machine learning to determine the “best” Airbnb - Lori
- Models to predict good/bad based on features (e.g. amenities, # rms, location) - Lori
- Linear regression (best time to buy); average $ per month - Brianna
- Apply models to compare with price - create our own star system (e.g. bins)
- Use ML to search comments for key words to determine quality of listings
- Clustering to compare quality with price
- Update user interface
